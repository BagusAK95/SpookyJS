The plan is to implement a minimal RPC core and then rebuild the old API atop
that. While were at it, lets also bring spooky up to date with a grunt build,
jshint, etc.

- set up grunt-dox
  - will prolly end up rolling our own at some point, but this is fine for now
  - write API dox for public API
- rewrite minimal core
  - start with stdio transport only, but pluggable from start
  - get the error story correct from the start
